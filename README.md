# Hi, I’m Jayanth

I’m a CS student at Georgia Tech focused on real-time systems, ML infrastructure, and developer tooling.

I’m interested in how complex systems behave under real constraints — latency, memory, concurrency, and long-running workloads — and how to make them safer, faster, and easier to use in practice.

---

## What I work on

- Real-time and performance-critical systems
- ML inference and tooling infrastructure
- OSS contributions focused on reliability, safety, and UX
- Debugging failure modes in long-running processes (memory leaks, process lifecycle, CI / platform issues)

---

## Open-source contributions

- **ACE-Step** — contributed UI/UX improvements, documentation, training stability fixes, and platform-specific debugging
- **claude-mem / claude-supermemory** — fixed process lifecycle and resource exhaustion issues in long-running daemons
- **AutoGPT** — contributed execution safety fixes and agent lifecycle handling

My contributions generally focus on edge cases, guardrails, and production stability rather than surface-level features.

## Personal work

- **Obliqzn** — real-time audiovisual systems exploring DSP, audio-reactive graphics, and performance-critical browser rendering
  - Built tools like ColorSynth and RadialField to study latency, signal analysis, and creative systems under real-time constraints

## How I think

I care about building things that don’t just work in demos, but continue working under real load, real users, and real time.
