Hi, I’m Jayanth.

I’m a CS student at Georgia Tech focused on real-time systems, ML infrastructure, and developer tooling. I’m interested in how complex systems behave under real constraints—latency, memory, concurrency, and long-running workloads—and how to make them safer and more reliable in practice.

I work on performance-critical systems and open-source projects, mostly around reliability, guardrails, and production stability. I’ve contributed to ACE-Step, claude-mem / claude-supermemory, and AutoGPT.

I also build Obliqzn, a set of real-time audiovisual systems exploring DSP, audio-reactive graphics, and performance-critical browser rendering.

I care about building things that keep working under real load, real users, and real time.
