Hi, I’m Jayanth.

I’m a CS student at Georgia Tech focused on real-time systems, ML infrastructure, and developer tooling. I’m interested in how complex systems behave under real constraints—latency, memory, concurrency, and long-running workloads—and how to make them safer and more reliable in practice.

I work on performance-critical systems, ML inference and tooling infrastructure, and open-source contributions focused on reliability, safety, and UX. A lot of my time goes into debugging failure modes in long-running processes, including memory leaks, process lifecycle issues, and platform or CI edge cases.

I’ve contributed to projects like ACE-Step, claude-mem / claude-supermemory, and AutoGPT, mostly around guardrails, stability fixes, and production safety rather than surface-level features.

I also build Obliqzn, a set of real-time audiovisual systems exploring DSP, audio-reactive graphics, and performance-critical browser rendering. Tools like ColorSynth and RadialField are experiments in latency, signal analysis, and creative systems under real-time constraints.

I care about building things that don’t just work in demos, but continue working under real load, real users, and real time.
